# ignore file for ag (i.e. The Silver Searcher).  Anything in here 
# is ignored globally.  To override this behavior for a specific search, 
# use one of the following flags:
# -U: don't use any .gitignore files, but do use .ignore (i.e. ones specific to ag)
# -u: unrestricted search (i.e. don't use any .ignore or .gitignore files)
